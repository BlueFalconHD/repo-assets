# I most likely will not accept any PR, because this isn't **actual** code, but here are my symbols for contributing:
- 📃: Markdown File

  Basically just means I created a markdown file
- 🖼️: Images

  If you see this, it means I have added new images.
- 💥: New Repository Added

  If you see this, I have added a new repository. Probably will procede some images.
